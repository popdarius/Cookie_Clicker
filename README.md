# Cookie_Clicker
This Python project uses Selenium to automatically play the popular browser game Cookie Clicker. The bot launches Chrome and then repeatedly clicks the big cookie as fast as possible. Every five seconds it reads the current cookie count and purchases the most expensive building or upgrade that is currently affordable.
